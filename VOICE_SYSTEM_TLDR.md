## Real-World Use Case: Pest Detection

```
Farmer in field. Sees weird leaf spots. Both hands full with tools.

Traditional way: Can't use phone (hands busy)

With Voice:
1. Say: "কীটপতঙ্গ" (Pest ID)
   → Camera opens, ready to scan
   
2. Frame the leaf
   
3. Make ✌️ gesture (peace sign)
   → Photo taken automatically
   
4. AI identifies: "চাঁচড়া পোকা" (Leaf folder pest)
   App speaks: "নিম তেল ছিটান" (Spray neem oil)
   
✅ Problem solved! Hands never left tools!
